# Problem 1 — `sum_to_n`

Compute the sum from `1` to `n`:

```
sum_to_n(5) === 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 === 15
```

There are **3 implementations** in [`index.ts`](./index.ts). This document explains how
each one works, analyzes its complexity in plain language, and includes **real measured
timing charts**.

> Note: the brief says `n` is *"any integer"*, so all three functions handle negatives
> symmetrically: `sum_to_n(-5) === -1 + -2 + -3 + -4 + -5 === -15`.

## A quick refresher on "complexity" (Big-O)

Big-O answers one question: **as `n` grows, how does the cost grow?**

| Notation | Plain meaning | Everyday analogy |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| `O(1)`   | **Constant** cost — same no matter how big `n` is | Punching a formula into a calculator |
| `O(n)`   | Cost grows **proportionally** with `n` | Counting each person in a queue |

- **Time:** how many operations you have to perform.
- **Space:** how much temporary memory you need.

---

## Option A — Gauss formula `n(n+1)/2`

```ts
export function sum_to_n_a(n: number): number {
  const sign = Math.sign(n);
  const m = Math.abs(n);
  return (sign * (m * (m + 1))) / 2;
}
```

**Idea:** Gauss noticed that pairing the first and last terms
(`1+n`, `2+(n-1)`, …) makes every pair equal `n+1`, and there are `n/2` pairs:

```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
└───────┬───────┘
  (1+5) + (2+4) + 3  =  6 + 6 + 3  =  15   →  5 × 6 / 2
```

- **Time: `O(1)`** — just a few multiply/add/divide operations, independent of `n`.
- **Space: `O(1)`** — no temporary memory needed.
- ✅ **Fastest, recommended.** Only downside: slightly "less obvious" if you don't know the formula.

---

## Option B — `for` loop

```ts
export function sum_to_n_b(n: number): number {
  let sum = 0;
  const step = n < 0 ? -1 : 1;
  for (let i = Math.abs(n); i > 0; i--) {
    sum += step * i;
  }
  return sum;
}
```

**Idea:** add the numbers one by one, exactly as defined.

- **Time: `O(n)`** — loops `n` times; double `n` and the time doubles.
- **Space: `O(1)`** — only one `sum` variable.
- ✅ **Most readable.** Fast enough for virtually every real-world case.

---

## Option C — Recursion

```ts
export function sum_to_n_c(n: number): number {
  if (n === 0) return 0;
  const next = n > 0 ? n - 1 : n + 1;
  return n + sum_to_n_c(next);
}
```

**Idea:** `sum(n) = n + sum(n-1)`, calling itself until it reaches `0`.

- **Time: `O(n)`** — still needs `n` calls.
- **Space: `O(n)`** ⚠️ — **each call takes one slot on the call stack**. This is the fatal weakness.
- ❌ **Least efficient.** For large `n` (measured: around **12,000–15,000**) it throws
  `Maximum call stack size exceeded`. Only worth keeping to demonstrate a third technique.

| ------ | -------------- | ------ | ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| A      | Gauss formula  | `O(1)` | `O(1)` | Fastest               | Requires knowing the formula          |
| B      | `for` loop     | `O(n)` | `O(1)` | Most readable         | Slows down as `n` grows               |
| C      | Recursion      | `O(n)` | `O(n)` | Elegant demonstration | **Stack overflow** for large `n` (~12k+) |

If you view this file on GitHub, the Mermaid chart below renders interactively:

```mermaid

    title "Time per call (ms) — log scale"
    x-axis "n" [10, 1000, 100000, 1000000]
    y-axis "ms / call"
    line "A - formula O(1)" [0.000027, 0.000016, 0.000061, 0.000281]
    line "B - loop O(n)" [0.000025, 0.000536, 0.065080, 0.816924]
```

*(Option C is not plotted because it overflows the stack at `n ≥ ~12,000`.)*

## Conclusion

- **For production → Option A.** `O(1)`, fastest, safe for any `n`.
- **For readable / teaching code → Option B.** `O(n)` but crystal clear, no stack-overflow risk.
- **Option C is illustrative only.** Concise, but its `O(n)` memory usage makes it unusable
  for large `n`.
